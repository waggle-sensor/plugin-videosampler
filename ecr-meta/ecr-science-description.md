# Video Sampling
Video sampling samples a series of images from a camera stream. This is one of the fundamental ways for collecting dataset that will later be used in training machine learning models. Taking video samples is an expensive task in terms of storage and network use, but is often very precious data to collect for machine learning models requiring good quality video data.
